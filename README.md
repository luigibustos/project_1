# Simon - A Game of Short-Term Memory Skill

## Overview

### What is Simon? 
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, working for toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates, with software programming by Lenny Cope. The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.

### Building Simon
As a part of General Assembly's Software Engineer Immersive program, I was tasked with building a simple game for my Project 1. I chose the game Simon. 

In order to build the game Simon. I created three core functions: 
- A function to generate and store a random sequence
- A function to display the sequence in order
- A function to accept user input and check against the current sequence

## Getting Started
[Project 1 - Simon Game](https://luigibustos.github.io/project_1/)

### How to Play
1. Click the 'Start' button in the Simon game console
2. The countdown clock will count down at the start of each round
3. Simon will flash the first sequence. Repeat the sequence when the game console signals 'Your Turn' 
4. Successfully repeating the sequence will automatically start the next round. Simon will continue to repeat the current sequence and add to the sequence each round. 
5. Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence. 
6. If you fail to repeat the sequence exactly, Simon will indicate 'Game Over!' through an alert.
